# Background

This code defines a Node.js AWS Lambda function named `orderCreate`. The function handles the event when an order is created in a Shopify store. It transforms the order data from the incoming event and inserts the transformed order into a MongoDB collection.

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1.  Import required modules and interfaces, including `IEventOrders` for typing the incoming event, `Context` from `aws-lambda` for typing the Lambda context, `transformOrderFromEvent` for transforming the incoming order event data, and the `mongo` module for connecting to MongoDB.
    
2.  Define the `orderCreate` async function, which accepts the event and context as arguments.
    
3.  Set `context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop` to `false` to make sure the Lambda function doesn't wait for the event loop to be empty before returning, improving performance.
    
4.  Log the incoming event's `X-Shopify-Topic` and the order ID from the event's payload.
    
5.  Log the entire `event.detail` as a JSON string.
    
6.  Call the `transformOrderFromEvent` function with the incoming event to transform the order data.
    
7.  If the order transformation is successful:
    
    a. Connect to the MongoDB database using the `mongo.db` function with the `MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable.
    
    b. Log the message indicating that the order is being inserted.
    
    c. Insert the transformed order into the 'orders' collection using the `insertOne` method.
    
    d. Log the success message, indicating that the order has been successfully handled.
    
8.  If the order transformation is not successful, log a message indicating that the transformation failed and the order is being skipped.
    
9.  Return from the function.
    
10.  Export the `main` constant, which is set to the `orderCreate` function.
    

In summary, this Lambda function listens for Shopify order creation events, transforms the incoming order data using the `transformOrderFromEvent` function, and inserts the transformed order into a MongoDB 'orders' collection. It provides feedback on whether the order was successfully inserted or if the transformation failed.
