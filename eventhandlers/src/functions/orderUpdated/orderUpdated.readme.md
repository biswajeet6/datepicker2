# Background

This code defines an AWS Lambda function `orderUpdated` that handles the update of an order in a MongoDB database when an order-related event is received. The function takes two arguments: `event`, which is an object containing information about the order, and `context`, which is an AWS Lambda context object.

1.  `context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop` is set to `false` to make sure that the Lambda function doesn't wait for the event loop to be empty before returning the response.
2.  The `console.log` statements are used to log the event information and the Shopify topic associated with the order.
3.  The `mongo.db` function is called to establish a connection to the MongoDB database using the connection string stored in the environment variable `MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING`.
4.  The function searches for the order in the `orders` collection of the database using the `store_id` and `order_id` values from the event object.
5.  If the order is found, it is updated using the `transformOrderFromEvent` function and the `updateOne` method. The updated fields include `tags`, `line_items`, `last_modified`, `note_attributes`, `shipping_lines`, and `postcode`.
6.  If the update is unsuccessful, an error is thrown. Otherwise, a success message is logged.
7.  If the order is not found, the function checks if the `ds-force-create` tag is present in the `tags` of the event payload. If the tag is present, the order is force-created using the `transformOrderFromEvent` function and the `insertOne` method. Otherwise, the order update is skipped.
8.  The function logs messages for each step, indicating whether the order update or creation was successful or skipped.

The `main` variable is set to the `orderUpdated` function, which can be imported and used by other modules or used as the main entry point for the Lambda function.
