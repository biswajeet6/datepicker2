# Background

This code defines an AWS Lambda function `orderDelete` that handles the deletion of an order from a MongoDB database when an order-related event is received. The function takes two arguments: `event`, which is an object containing information about the order, and `context`, which is an AWS Lambda context object.

1.  `context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop` is set to `false` to make sure that the Lambda function doesn't wait for the event loop to be empty before returning the response.
2.  The `console.log` statements are used to log the event information and the Shopify topic associated with the order.
3.  The `mongo.db` function is called to establish a connection to the MongoDB database using the connection string stored in the environment variable `MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING`.
4.  The function searches for the order in the `orders` collection of the database using the `store_id` and `order_id` values from the event object.
5.  If the order is found, it is deleted from the `orders` collection using the `deleteOne` method and the `_id` property of the order.
6.  The function logs whether the order deletion was successful or if the order was not found.

The `main` variable is set to the `orderDelete` function, which can be imported and used by other modules or used as the main entry point for the Lambda function.
