# Background

Note: the function called here is orderUpdated not order cancelled.

This code defines a Node.js AWS Lambda function named `orderUpdated`. The function handles the event when an order in a Shopify store is updated. It checks if the order exists in a MongoDB collection and, if so, deletes the order from the collection.

Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1.  Import required modules and interfaces, including `IEventOrders` for typing the incoming event, `Context` from `aws-lambda` for typing the Lambda context, `ObjectID` from `mongodb` for working with MongoDB ObjectID, `IOrder` for typing the order object, and the `mongo` module for connecting to MongoDB.
2.  Define the `orderUpdated` async function, which accepts the event, context, and callback as arguments.
3.  Set `context.callbackWaitsForEmptyEventLoop` to `false` to make sure the Lambda function doesn't wait for the event loop to be empty before returning, improving performance.
4.  Use a try-catch block to handle potential errors.
5.  Inside the try block, log the incoming event's `X-Shopify-Topic`.
6.  Connect to the MongoDB database using the `mongo.db` function with the `MONGO_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable.
7.  Find the order in the 'orders' collection using the `findOne` method, searching by the `store_id` (from the event's `X-Shopify-Shop-Domain` metadata) and `order_id` (from the event's payload).
8.  If the order exists, delete the order from the 'orders' collection using the `deleteOne` method with the order's `_id`.
9.  Log the success message, then call the `callback` function with `null` (no error) and the result string 'success'.
10.  If the order does not exist, log a message indicating that the order doesn't exist and is being ignored, then call the `callback` function with `null` (no error) and the result string 'ignored'.
11.  In the catch block, call the `callback` function with the error and the result string 'error'.
12.  Export the `main` constant, which is set to the `orderUpdated` function.
    

In summary, this Lambda function listens for Shopify order updates, checks if the order exists in a MongoDB 'orders' collection, and if it does, deletes the order from the collection. It provides feedback on whether the order was successfully deleted, ignored, or if an error occurred.
