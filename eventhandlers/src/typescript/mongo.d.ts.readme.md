# Background

This script defines a set of TypeScript interfaces related to an order object. These interfaces describe the structure of the order object and its related properties, such as line items, note attributes, and tag history. The interfaces help enforce type safety when working with order objects in TypeScript, allowing developers to identify and fix potential issues during the development process.

Here's a brief overview of the interfaces:

1.  `IOrderLineItem`: Represents a line item in the order, containing properties like `id`, `variant_id`, `quantity`, and an optional `line_date`.
2.  `IOrderNoteAttribute`: Represents a note attribute in the order, containing properties like `name` and `value`.
3.  `ITagHistoryItem`: Represents a tag history item for the order, containing properties like `tags` (an array of strings) and `timestamp`.
4.  `IOrder`: Represents the main order object, containing properties like `_id`, `store_id`, `order_id`, `internal_status`, `internal_message`, `internal_retry`, `order_number`, `tags`, `line_items`, `note_attributes`, `shipping_lines`, `shipping_method`, `postcode`, `region_id`, `local_pickup`, `externally_shipped`, `tag_history`, `nominated_date`, and `last_modified`.

The main `IOrder` interface is used to describe the overall structure of the order object, while the other interfaces (`IOrderLineItem`, `IOrderNoteAttribute`, and `ITagHistoryItem`) describe different aspects of the order. By using these interfaces, developers can create well-structured and type-safe code when working with order-related data in a TypeScript project.
