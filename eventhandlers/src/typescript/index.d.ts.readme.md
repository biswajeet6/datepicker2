# Background

This script defines a set of TypeScript interfaces and an enum related to event orders. These interfaces describe the structure of an event order object, which appears to be related to a Shopify order event. The interfaces are organized hierarchically, with the main `IEventOrders` interface containing the top-level structure and other interfaces representing various properties of the event order.

Here's a brief overview of the interfaces and the enum:

1.  `IEventOrders`: Represents the top-level structure of an event order object, containing properties like `version`, `id`, `detail-type`, `source`, `account`, `time`, `region`, `resources`, and `detail`.
2.  `IEventOrdersDetail`: Represents the details of the event order, containing `payload` and `metadata`.
3.  `IEventOrdersMetadata`: Represents the metadata of the event order, containing various Shopify-related properties like `Content-Type`, `X-Shopify-Topic`, `X-Shopify-Shop-Domain`, `X-Shopify-Order-Id`, etc.
4.  `IEventOrdersPayload`: Represents the payload of the event order, containing detailed information about the order like customer details, line items, total price, currency, shipping address, etc.
5.  `IEventOrdersAddress`: Represents the address of a customer, containing properties like `first_name`, `address1`, `phone`, `city`, `zip`, `province`, `country`, `last_name`, etc.
6.  `IEventOrdersCurrency`: An enum representing the currency used in the order, with one value, `Gbp`, which stands for British Pound Sterling (GBP).
7.  `IEventOrdersCustomer`: Represents the customer who placed the order, containing properties like `id`, `email`, `accepts_marketing`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `orders_count`, etc.
8.  `IEventOrdersLineItem`: Represents a line item in the order, containing properties like `id`, `variant_id`, `title`, `quantity`, `sku`, `variant_title`, `vendor`, `fulfillment_service`, etc.
9.  `IEventOrdersSet`: Represents a set of money values for shop money and presentment money, containing `shop_money` and `presentment_money`.
10.  `IEventOrdersMoney`: Represents a money object with `amount` and `currency_code`.
11.  `IEventOrdersTaxLine`: Represents a tax line in the order, containing properties like `title`, `price`, `rate`, and `price_set`.

These interfaces are used to enforce type safety when working with event order objects in TypeScript. They help developers identify and fix potential issues during the development process by providing strict typing and structure for the data being used.
