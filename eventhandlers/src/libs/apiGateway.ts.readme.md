This script defines TypeScript types and a utility function for working with AWS Lambda functions that process API Gateway Proxy events. The script does the following:

1.  Import necessary types:
    
    -   `APIGatewayProxyEvent`, `APIGatewayProxyResult`, and `Handler` from the `aws-lambda` package to handle API Gateway Proxy events and results.
    -   `FromSchema` from the `json-schema-to-ts` package to convert JSON schema to TypeScript types.
2.  Define a `ValidatedAPIGatewayProxyEvent` type, which takes a generic schema `S`. This type is created by omitting the `body` property from the `APIGatewayProxyEvent` and extending it with a new `body` property that is typed using the `FromSchema` type from the `json-schema-to-ts` package. This allows for better type checking and validation of the incoming event's body based on the provided JSON schema.
    
3.  Define a `ValidatedEventAPIGatewayProxyEvent` type, which takes a generic schema `S`. This type is an `aws-lambda` `Handler` that takes a `ValidatedAPIGatewayProxyEvent<S>` as the event and returns an `APIGatewayProxyResult`. This type is useful for defining Lambda functions that have validated event bodies based on the provided JSON schema.
    
4.  Define a `formatJSONResponse` utility function that takes a response object of type `Record<string, unknown>`. The function formats the response by returning an object with a `statusCode` of 200 and a `body` that is the JSON string representation of the response object. This utility function is useful for formatting successful responses from Lambda functions that are processing API Gateway Proxy events.
    

In summary, this script provides TypeScript types and a utility function for working with AWS Lambda functions that handle API Gateway Proxy events with JSON schema-based validation and type checking for the event body.
