# Background

This function, `middyfy`, takes a single argument `handler`, which is typically an AWS Lambda function handler. The purpose of the function is to apply the Middy middleware to the given handler and, specifically, use the `middyJsonBodyParser` middleware.

Here's how the function works:

1.  It calls `middy(handler)`, which creates a new instance of the Middy middleware engine for the given `handler`. Middy is a popular middleware framework for AWS Lambda functions that enables easy integration of middleware functions to extend and modify the behavior of the Lambda function.
    
2.  It then chains the `.use(middyJsonBodyParser())` call, which adds the `middyJsonBodyParser` middleware to the Middy middleware engine. The `middyJsonBodyParser` middleware is responsible for automatically parsing JSON-encoded request bodies and adding the resulting object to the `event.body` property. This simplifies working with JSON data in your Lambda functions.
    
3.  The function returns the modified Lambda handler with the applied middleware.
    

The `middyfy` function simplifies adding middleware to AWS Lambda handlers by encapsulating the process of applying Middy and the JSON body parser middleware. This makes it easier to use in multiple Lambda functions across your project.
