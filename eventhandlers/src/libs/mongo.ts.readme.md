# Background

This script exports a `mongo` object with a single method, `db`, which is a function that accepts a `uri` (MongoDB connection string) as an argument. The purpose of this function is to create and manage a cached MongoDB client instance, allowing for the reuse of an existing MongoDB connection across multiple AWS Lambda invocations, thus reducing the overhead of establishing a new connection each time.

Here's how the function works:

1.  It checks if there is a cached instance of a MongoDB connection (`cachedInstance`) and if it is connected. If there is, it logs '=> using cached client instance' and returns a resolved promise with the cached instance.
    
2.  If there is no connected cached instance, it connects to MongoDB using `MongoClient.connect()`, passing the `uri` and a configuration object with `useUnifiedTopology` set to `true`. This option enables the new connection management engine, which is recommended for better compatibility and performance.
    
3.  When the connection is established, it logs '=> creating new client instance', sets `cachedInstance` to the newly created database instance, and returns it.
    

The script provides a mechanism to cache and reuse MongoDB connections in an AWS Lambda environment, which helps improve performance by reducing the time it takes to establish a new connection for each Lambda invocation. This is particularly useful in cases where Lambda functions are frequently called, as it helps reduce the latency associated with connecting to MongoDB.

The function also includes some commented out code at the bottom, which represents an older handling method that would have been replicated in each individual handler file. This older method has now been encapsulated within the exported `mongo` object.
