# Background

This function, `handlerPath`, takes a single argument `context`, which is a string representing a file path. The purpose of the function is to return a modified file path string that is relative to the current working directory and has forward slashes as separators.

Here's how the function works:

1.  It first calls `context.split(process.cwd())`, which splits the input `context` string using the current working directory path. This results in an array containing the parts of the path before and after the current working directory.
    
2.  It then takes the second element of the resulting array using `[1]`. This corresponds to the part of the path that comes after the current working directory.
    
3.  It removes the leading slash, if present, using `substring(1)`. This is done to ensure that the resulting path is relative and not considered as an absolute path by the system.
    
4.  Finally, it replaces all backslashes (\) with forward slashes (/) using `.replace(/\\/g, '/')`. This is done to ensure consistency in path separators, especially in environments where both types of slashes might be used (e.g., Windows).
    

The `handlerPath` function returns a modified file path that is relative to the current working directory and uses forward slashes as separators, making it more consistent and platform-independent.
