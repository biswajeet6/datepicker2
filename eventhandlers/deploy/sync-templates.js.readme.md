# Background


This code is a Node.js script that syncs files between a local directory and an AWS S3 bucket. The script uses the AWS CLI `s3 sync` command to perform the synchronization. The sync direction (from local to AWS or from AWS to local) is determined by a command-line argument provided when running the script. Here's a breakdown of what the script does:

1.  Import the `exec` function from the `child_process` module, which allows running shell commands within the script.
2.  Check if the `STAGE` environment variable is set; if not, throw an error.
3.  Read the command-line arguments, excluding the first two (which are the node executable and the script path) using `process.argv.slice(2)`.
4.  Check if the first command-line argument is provided and if it's either "local" or "aws". If not, throw an error with a usage message.
5.  Construct the `aws s3 sync` command based on the provided argument:
    -   If the argument is "local", sync the S3 bucket to the local ".serverless" directory.
    -   If the argument is "aws", sync the local ".serverless" directory to the S3 bucket. The `--delete` flag is used to delete extraneous files from the destination directory.
6.  Run the constructed command using the `exec` function. If an error occurs or there's output on the `stderr` stream, log the error and throw a "Failed to sync AWS bucket" error. If the command succeeds, log the output on the `stdout` stream.

In summary, this script provides a convenient way to synchronize files between a local ".serverless" directory and a specified AWS S3 bucket based on the provided command-line argument and `STAGE` environment variable.
